		IDA loader and processor module for i0

INSTALL:

i0 processor module:

	Copy bin/i0/<Configuration>/i064.w64 to <IDA_installation>/procs
	Make sure there is no z864.w64 file on that directory since currently 
	i064.w64 uses the same processor description “z8”.
	
i0 loader module:

	Copy bin/i0_ldr/<Configuration>/i0ldr64.l64 to <IDA_installation>/loaders

RUN:
	
	Both modules rely on the map file generated by cc0 in order to analyze 
	i0 binary. Please put the map file in the same directory as the i0 binary. 
	To do analysis, drag the i0 binary to IDA window, and chose the 
	"i0 program file" in the dialog. Other options will be set automatically 
	after click "OK"
	
DEBUG:
	
	The pdb files reside in the same directory as both modules are provided
	for debugging purposes.
