		IDA loader and processor module for i0

INSTALL:

i0 processor module:

	Copy bin/i0/<Configuration>/i064.w64 to <IDA_installation>/procs
	
i0 loader module:

	Copy bin/i0_ldr/<Configuration>/i0ldr64.l64 to <IDA_installation>/loaders

RUN:
	
	Both modules rely on the map file generated by cc0 in order to analyze 
	i0 binary. Please put the map file in the same directory as the i0 binary. 
	To do analysis, run idag64.exe or idaq64.exe, drag the i0 binary to IDA 
	window, and chose the "i0 program file" in the dialog. Other options will 
	be set automatically after click "OK"
	
DEBUG:
	
	The pdb files reside in the same directory as both modules are provided
	for debugging purposes.
